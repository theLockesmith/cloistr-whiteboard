# Runtime service configuration in this app — tasks

- [x] Test the service-address resolution first, red before green. (verified: suite failed to resolve the module before it existed, exit 1; green after)
- [x] One service-address module, delegating to the shared reader. (verified: src/lib/serviceAddresses.ts)
- [x] Relay read from it instead of a literal. (verified: App.tsx diff)
- [x] File host read from it instead of a literal. (verified: Whiteboard.tsx diff)
- [x] Signer passed explicitly to the shared auth provider. (verified: App.tsx diff)
- [x] Shared package dependency raised to the version carrying the runtime tier. (verified: collab-common 0.4.0 plus auth ^1.4.1, ui 0.42.2 and yjs ^13.6.33 so one yjs copy is shared; npm ls shows a single yjs; clean npm ci exit 0)
- [x] Serving config becomes a template, with an exact-match configuration
      location that forbids caching. (verified: config.js served no-store in the staging container)
- [x] Entry page loads the configuration before the bundle. (verified: built dist/index.html keeps the config.js tag)
- [x] Serving stage carries production defaults and restricts the substitution
      filter. (verified: no-env container served production values)
- [x] Build the image. (verified: docker build exit 0, local image sha256:24aa14f4af21)
- [x] No-environment run reports production hosts. (verified: browser check PASS, app mounted beyond the static loading placeholder)
- [x] Staging run reports staging hosts and makes NO request to a production
      host, observed in a real browser. (verified: browser check PASS, zero production requests or sockets)
- [ ] Record the image digest for whoever stands this up in staging.
