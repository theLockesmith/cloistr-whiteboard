/**
 * Why this test exists.
 *
 * This app decided its relay in App.tsx, its file host from a literal in
 * Whiteboard.tsx, and its signer not at all (the shared auth provider fell
 * back to a hardcoded production default). A staging deployment of this image
 * would have uploaded to the production file host and signed in against the
 * production signer.
 *
 * resolveServiceAddresses is the single place that decision now happens. The
 * assertions below are the app's half of the done criteria: production
 * unchanged, and a staging environment reaching no production host.
