 * One named home for the decision, with a test. Before this, the relay was
 * decided in App.tsx, the file host was a literal in Whiteboard.tsx, and the
 * signer was not decided here at all (the shared auth provider fell back to its
 * own hardcoded production default). None of that could be asserted about
 * without rendering the app.
